    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 9, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Numyn (&ldquo;Numyn&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) collects,
      uses, and protects your personal information in connection with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Numyn marketing website (including <code>numyn.ca</code> and any subdomains).</li>
      <li>Our waitlist and early-access sign-up forms.</li>
      <li>Emails and support requests you send to us.</li>
      <li>Licensing, purchase, and account-related information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Numyn is developed and operated by a sole proprietor based in Ontario, Canada. We aim to handle your personal information
      in line with applicable Canadian privacy requirements, including the
      <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (PIPEDA) and any other provincial laws that may apply.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope and key concepts</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to personal information that we collect and control, such as information you provide through our website,
      waitlist forms, licensing system, or support channels. &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; means information about an identifiable
      individual, such as a name, email address, or contact details.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Local bookkeeping data inside the Numyn desktop app</strong> is treated differently:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Numyn is designed as a primarily local desktop application. Your bookkeeping data (e.g., income, expenses, clients, suppliers)
        is stored on your own device by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do <strong>not</strong> automatically receive or host your bookkeeping data on our own servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        If cloud backup or sync features are introduced in the future, they will be clearly described, be optional, and this policy
        will be updated to explain how any additional data is handled.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What information we collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Website, usage, and technical information</h3>
    <p>When you visit our website, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standard web server logs (IP address, browser type, operating system, pages viewed, timestamps).</li>
      <li>
        Basic usage information in an aggregated or de-identified form to understand how often the site is visited and which sections
        are most useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we enable analytics in the future, non-identifying technical information such as approximate region, device type,
        and browsing behaviour on our site.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Waitlist and early-access sign-ups</h3>
    <p>
      If you join the Numyn waitlist or request early access, we may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your email address (required).</li>
      <li>Your name and/or business name (optional).</li>
      <li>Information about your business type or location, if you choose to share it (optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use this information to manage the waitlist, contact you about early access opportunities, invite you to beta programs,
      and send updates about Numyn’s launch and related features.
    </p>
    <!-- NEW explicit unsubscribe language -->
    <p>
      If you no longer wish to receive waitlist or launch updates, you can unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe form
      on our <a href="waitlist.html">waitlist page</a> or by contacting us at
      <a href="mailto:support@numyn.ca">support@numyn.ca</a>. If you unsubscribe, we will remove your email from the waitlist records,
      subject to any minimal retention that may be required for legal or technical reasons (for example, to honour your opt-out).
    </p>
    <!-- end new -->

    <h3>2.3 Purchases, licensing, and billing</h3>
    <p>
      When Numyn licenses are available for purchase, we plan to use a third-party payment and licensing provider
      (for example, Lemon Squeezy or a similar service). During checkout, that provider may collect information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name and contact information.</li>
      <li>Billing address and country.</li>
      <li>Payment method details (e.g., card information).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> receive or store your full payment card number on our own systems.
      We may receive limited purchase details from the provider—such as your name, email address, country, and license key—
      to create and manage your license, send receipts, and provide support.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Support and direct communications</h3>
    <p>
      If you email us (for example, at <a href="mailto:support@numyn.ca">support@numyn.ca</a>) or contact us through a form,
      we may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name and email address.</li>
      <li>The content of your message and any attachments you choose to send.</li>
      <li>Technical details you provide to help troubleshoot an issue (e.g., operating system, Numyn version).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We use personal information for purposes such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing access to Numyn and managing licensing and activation.</li>
      <li>Sending waitlist updates, launch announcements, and product information (with your consent).</li>
      <li>Responding to support requests, bug reports, and feature feedback.</li>
      <li>Sending important notices about security, compatibility, or critical product changes.</li>
      <li>Operating, maintaining, and improving our website and services.</li>
      <li>Keeping business and accounting records as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For marketing-type emails (like waitlist updates and launch news), we rely on your
      <strong>express consent</strong>. You can withdraw that consent at any time by using an unsubscribe option provided in the email
      (where available) or through the unsubscribe form on our waitlist page, or by contacting us directly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Legal bases and consent</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location and the context, we may rely on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your consent</strong> – for example, when you join the waitlist or sign up to receive updates.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – for example, when we process information necessary to provide your Numyn license
        or support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – such as improving our services or preventing fraud, in ways that are balanced with
        your privacy rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal obligations</strong> – such as record-keeping under tax or business laws.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Under Canadian anti-spam rules (including CASL), we will not send you promotional emails about Numyn without your consent.
      When you join the waitlist, you are explicitly consenting to receive emails about Numyn, its launch, and related updates.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
    <p>
      At launch, the Numyn site is intended to use minimal cookies, primarily for basic site functionality and security.
      If we introduce analytics, A/B testing, or similar tools that use cookies or tracking technologies, we will update this policy
      and make reasonable efforts to explain what is being used and why.
    </p>

    <h2>6. How we share information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited personal information with third parties in these situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers</strong> – such as payment processors, email service providers, website hosting, and error-reporting
        or analytics tools used to operate Numyn and the website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business or legal obligations</strong> – if required by law, regulation, court order, or in response to lawful
        requests by public authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business changes</strong> – in the event of a reorganization, sale, or other business transaction involving Numyn,
        where personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable laws.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some of these service providers may be located outside of Canada (for example, in the United States or the European Union),
      which means your information may be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep your personal information only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining your license and purchase history.</li>
      <li>Responding to support requests and tracking ongoing issues.</li>
      <li>Complying with tax, accounting, and other legal requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you ask us to delete certain information, we will do so where possible, subject to any legal obligations to retain records
      for a longer period (for example, for tax or audit purposes).
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information we control from unauthorized
      access, use, or disclosure. However, no online or email transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
      security of information transmitted over the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are responsible for safeguarding your own devices and any local Numyn data stored on them, including using appropriate
      passwords, encryption, and backups where applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your rights and choices</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to request access to the personal information we hold about you.</li>
      <li>The right to request correction or updates to inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
      <li>The right to withdraw consent to marketing communications at any time.</li>
      <li>
        In some cases, the right to request deletion of personal information, subject to legal or contractual restrictions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- small extra clarification -->
    <p>
      For waitlist and launch-update emails, you can withdraw your consent at any time by unsubscribing using the form on our
      waitlist page or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@numyn.ca">support@numyn.ca</a>. We will respect your choice
      and stop sending those communications, subject to any necessary confirmation emails or records of your opt-out.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@numyn.ca">support@numyn.ca</a>.
      We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Numyn is intended for adult users who operate or manage a business. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
      children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can
      take appropriate steps to delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, services, or legal obligations.
      When we do, we will update the &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date at the top of this page. In cases of material changes, we may
      provide additional notice (for example, via the website or by email, where appropriate).
    </p>
